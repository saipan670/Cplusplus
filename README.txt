The population of a town A is less than the population of a town B. 
However, the population of town A is growing faster than the population of town B. 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the population and growth rate of each town. 
The program outputs after how many years the population of town A will be greater than or equal 
to the population of town B and the populations of both towns at that time.
