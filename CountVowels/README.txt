Write a program that reads a string and outputs the number of times each 
lowercase vowel appears in it. Your program must contain a function with 
one of its parameters as a string variable and return the number of times each 
lowercase vowel appears in it. Also write a program to test your function. 
(Note that if str is a variable of type string, then str.at(i) returns the 
character at the ith position. The position of the first character is 0. 
Also, str.length() returns the length of the str, that is, the number of
characters in str.)
