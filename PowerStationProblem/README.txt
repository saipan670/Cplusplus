(The power station problem) A power station is on one side of a river 
that is one-half mile wide, and a factory is 8 miles downstream on 
the other side of the river (see Figure 6-18). It costs $7 per foot to 
run power lines over land and $9 per foot to run them under water. Your objective is 
to determine the most economical path to lay the power line. That is, determine how 
long the power line should run under water and how long it should run over land to 
chieve the minimum total cost of laying the power line.
